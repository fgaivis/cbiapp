                                Leadership Development Initiative
							</h3>
							<p>
								The Leadership Development Initiative (LDI) is a signature 12-month program of Community Building Initiative (CBI) supports non-profit board members and senior staff of non-profit, public and for-profit organizations in the leadership role they and their organizations play in building a more inclusive and equitable Charlotte-Mecklenburg. LDI develops, connects and guides diverse groups of leaders (28 – 32 per class) in increasing their awareness of and ability to influence for inclusion and equity. LDI's long-term goal is to increase participating organizations' commitment to and capacity for promoting access, inclusion and equity in our community. <br>

								The focus and impact of LDI goes beyond personal engagement to civic responsibility and organizational leadership. Boards of directors and senior staff of local non-profits are uniquely positioned to effect community change, and because of their power to influence organizational policies and practices and leverage financial and human resources, non-profits are a primary focus of LDI. CBI did expand membership in LDI to include public sector organizations (Mecklenburg County, City of Charlotte and CMS) in 2004, and the first for-profit organization (Piedmont Natural Gas) entered LDI in 2012. These organizations are poised to become vehicles for community change on issues of inclusion and equity.<br>

							</h3>
							<p>
								As part of Community Building Initiative’s mission to increase the capacity and commitment of individuals and organizations to work for change, CBI itself is committed to convening groups of leaders interested in creating a more just, more inclusive community. <br>

								Leaders Under 40 (LU40) engages influential professionals and emerging community leaders who want to explore the building of connections across difference, learn more about our community and real-time community issues and have opportunities to connect with established leaders in Charlotte-Mecklenburg. <br>

								The goal of LU40 is to convene an inclusive, cross-sector group of participants that reflect diversity across race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion, time in Charlotte-Mecklenburg, employment, background and perspective and to support them to become leaders for inclusion and equity in our increasingly diverse and changing community.<br>

							</h3>
							<p>
								Launched in 2011, the CBI Bus Tours are intended as an innovative, interactive approach to bringing the history of Charlotte to life, while exploring how our shared history and “what’s in the ground” in our community impacts our present and our future. <br>
								The tours were developed and tested with the support of a grant from the Arts & Science Council.  Based on the success of the pilot tour series, Charlotte in Black & White. . .and More, CBI launched its bus tours as an ongoing program in June 2012, offering community tours on the second Friday of every other month thanks to support provided by Wells Fargo Community Development, Foundation For The Carolinas and Bank of America.  Tours have been developed in collaboration with Tom Hanchett (Levine Museum of the New South) and John Howard (City of Charlotte, Historic Districts Commission).   <br>

							</h3>
							<p>
								As a result of the upheaval that took place in 2008 around the appointment of a new Mecklenburg County Sheriff, Community Building Initiative (CBI), the Community Relations Committee (CRC) and Mecklenburg Ministries released a joint statement – an open letter to the community – called “Salting the Roads” to encourage community residents to dig deep, reflect, and connect with one another to examine why appointing a new sheriff was such a divisive issue for this community. <br>

							</h3>
							<p>
								First organized in 1999, the Stakeholders Breakfast is an annual event hosted by Community Building Initiative (CBI) in order to gather the key funders and community stakeholders to update them on the group’s work, celebrate the year’s accomplishments, and present plans for the upcoming year, encouraging continued support for CBI. These annual events are important for both the present and future of CBI because it allows them to share and address current issues, while also receiving direct feedback regarding community concerns that could be addressed by CBI and partnering organizations. The CBI Stakeholders Breakfast consistently sets the platform for a diverse, cross-section of the community to connect, mutually benefiting one another. <br>
